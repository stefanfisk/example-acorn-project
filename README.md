# Acorn Example Project

A simple example of how Acorn can be used with a Laravel like folder structure.

`public/content/themes/app` contains a minimal shim theme to make WordPress happy, but the actual templates and resources reside in `resources`.

Run `./dev/bin/setup` to add entries to `/etc/hosts`, copy `.env`, etc. After that the project can be started with `./dev/bin/up`.
